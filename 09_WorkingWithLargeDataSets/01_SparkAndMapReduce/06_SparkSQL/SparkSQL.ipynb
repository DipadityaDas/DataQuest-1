In this mission, we'll learn how to use Spark's SQL interface to query and interact with the data. We'll continue to work with the 2010 U.S. Census data set in this mission. Later on, we'll add other files to demonstrate how to take advantage of SQL to work with multiple data sets."

This means you'll have to use __show()__ to display the results, due to lazy loading.\n",
