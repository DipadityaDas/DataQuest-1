# An example is when you use random numbers to select a subset of the data, and you want other people
# looking at the same data to get the same subset.
# We can ensure this by setting a random seed.
# A random seed is an integer that is used to "seed" a random number generator.
# After a random seed is set, the numbers generated after will follow the same sequence.
