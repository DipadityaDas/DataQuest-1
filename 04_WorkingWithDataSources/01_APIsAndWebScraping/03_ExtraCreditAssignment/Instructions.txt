To Truly reinforce and learn the concepts of API usage I feel it would be very important to do the following mini-self assingnment for practice
Refer to 
    1) Get my own OAuth2 authentication token, and verify my token works using the status_code.
    2) Get the 10 top/new/hot posts in /r/python.
    3) Get the 5 new/hot/top comments in each of the top 10 posts in /r/funny.
    4) Post a comment to a subreddit.
    5) Find any reddit users comment history and get their 10 highest rated comments.
    6) Subscribe to a subreddit
    7) Download an image etc.
