This "challenge" has you do the following...
1.) Install git
	a.) All I did in LinxMint 18.2 was type a git command 
		which then told me it wasn't installed.
		It then printed the commmand to install git, which I then typed.
		Real tough?!?
2.) Configure git
	a.) git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
	b.) git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
3.) Create a git hub account (Which I alread have)
4.) Authenticating with GitHub
	a.) This is done automatically by cloning a repository
5.) Going forward I'm going to do everything using git hub
