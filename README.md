# Self-Directed Data Science Bootcamp 

## Below is a list of topics covered in meticulous detail.
In an effort to transition my career from that of a Chemist & Data Automation Specialist to a Data Scientist, I followed the self-guided curriculum laid out by [DataQuest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/).  I elected to skip the first Chapter as I was already very strong in the basics of python.  I already have 2+ years of Python/SQLite data extraction, cleansing, and analysis experience.  The code for each [DataQuest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/) mission is included in the repo.

Unfortunately, the sheer volume and size of the raw csv files used, vastly exceeds the file size limitation imposed by github.  Therefore, Iâ€™ve have included \*.csv files on the .gitignore file.

### 2. Data Analysis, Visualization, & Cleaning
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * Jupyter Notebook
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * basemap
  * regular expressions (re)
  
### 3. Linux Command Line
  * Running a Linux VM
  * Nagivation
  * Working with files
  * Running python scripts from the command line
  * Pipng & redirecting output
  * csv toolkit
  * git
  * git remotes (github, .gitignore)
  
### 4. Working with Data Sources
  * API's (requests)
  * JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
  * Authentication (OAuth2)
  * Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup)
  * SQL (Joins, WITH VIEW, UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT, ect...)
  * SQLite (sqlite3)
  * Database normalization
  * PostgreSQL (psycopg2, PostgreSQL Command-line, .pgpass)
  * Database indexing

### 5. Probability and Statistics
  * Standard Deviation & Correlation
  * Linear Regression
  * Disributions & Sampling
  * Probabilities
  * Probability Distributions
  * Chi-Squared Tests
  * Multi Category Chi-Squared Tests
  * Major Python Libraries Utilized:
    * scipy.stats

      * kurtosis
      * norm
      * pearsonr
      * linregress
      * binom
      * chisquare
      * chi2_contingency
      * linspace (note, this one is in scipy, not scipy.stats)
    * math
    * functools
    * operator
